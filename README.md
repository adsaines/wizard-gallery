Wizard gallery! We'll be consuming a harry potter API and displaying it's contents for the user to enjoy! It will be amazing!

# TODO List

1) Make React Project
2) Get a component to display something that we want
3) Play with our chosen API... https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html
3) Consume and show one of the items in the API
4) Create a form for that item
5) Repeat 3/4 add-nasuem until API is all consumed

Also, somewhere in here we need to make a branch or two.
